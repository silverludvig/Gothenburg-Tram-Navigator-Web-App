# Gothenburg-Tram-Navigator-Web-App

This application allows users to ask questions about the shortest or fastest routes between any two points, providing a comprehensive solution for route optimization within Gothenburg's tram network. 

The application is divided into three parts:

1. **Data Integration Module**:  In this first part, I focus on gathering and combining data from various sources and formats, such as plain text and JSON, to build a comprehensive and unified database.

2. **Graph Analysis Engine**: The second part involves developing a set of tools for analyzing different types of graph-based data, including transportation networks.

3. **Web Interface**: The final part is about creating a dynamic web server and user interface that allows users to explore and visualize the best transit routes.
