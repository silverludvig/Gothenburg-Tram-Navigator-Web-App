# Gothenburg-Tram-Navigator-Web-App

This application serves as a comprehensive solution for route optimization within Gothenburg's tram network, facilitating user inquiries about the fastest or shortest routes between any two points. Designed to support daily commuters in their transit planning, this tool significantly enhances the efficiency of urban transportation systems.

The application is architecturally segmented into three primary components, each aligning with a specific phase of development and corresponding to a series of targeted educational lectures:
1. **Data Integration Module**: This initial phase focuses on Information Extraction, where diverse data from multiple sources and formats (including plain text and JSON) are aggregated to form a comprehensive database.
2. **Graph Analysis Engine**: The second phase involves constructing a versatile library of graph analysis tools, not limited to transport networks but extendable to various types of graph-based data structures. This involves intensive exercises in object-oriented design to ensure scalability and robustness.
3. **Interactive Web Interface**: The final component encompasses building a dynamic web server and user interface, enabling end-users to interactively query and visualize optimal transit routes. This component integrates advanced visualization libraries and web framework technologies.
